# Yarn
A tool to provide a complete environment for a writer to pen down his thoughts, including ways to overcome the Writer's Block.

Yarn is an editor (in the prototype phase) for the writer which :
* provides important keywords used in the text
* provides all character names side by side
* provides synonyms when right-clicked on a selected word
* changes the theme of the page according to the genre of your text
* provides sentence prediction using a **Markov chain** when the writer's block is encountered
* enables you to save it as a text file or upload it to Wattpad
